# Terraform & Heroku

In this repo, you'll find a structure template for terraform files used to create a simple app in Heroku
<br>
As for now, the Heroku project only contain an base app and a database integration
<br>
In order to use this as template, you need to specify a <i>terraform.tfvars</i> file for some variables. 
<br>
As for now, those are...
<br>
    heroku_develop_app
    heroku_develop_database
    heroku_region
    heroku_app_buildpacks
